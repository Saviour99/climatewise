                <h1>Thematic Areas</h1>
                <p>Each thematic area represents a strategic pillar of intervention designed to address critical and interconnected dimensions of community development. Together, these thematic areas form a holistic framework that integrates environmental sustainability, public health, youth leadership, and evidence-based decision-making. The approach recognizes that climate resilience, WASH, environmental management, and youth empowerment are mutually reinforcing and must be addressed simultaneously to achieve lasting and equitable impact at the community level.</p>
